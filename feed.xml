Originally introduced for machine translation in the seminal paper “Attention is All you Need” by Vaswani et al. (2017) <d-cite key="vaswani2017attention"></d-cite>, transformers have since become the foundation for most modern NLP systems.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blogposts/transformer-block-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blogposts/transformer-block-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blogposts/transformer-block-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blogposts/transformer-block.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> <b>Figure 1:</b> Overview of the Transformer Architecture (<a href="https://pub.aimind.so/summary-of-transformer-achitecture-c2cef6dcaca6">Source</a>). </div> <h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1> <p>The motivation behind the transformer architecture lies in the limitations found in the previous state-of-the-art architectures for seq2seq tasks that used Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).</p> <p>The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture encoded the context from previous time steps in a single “state vector” that is continuously updated as information flows through each processing step. However, this results in the state vector suffering significant changes from one step to the next, and thus losing previous context quickly, especially from far-away previous steps.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blogposts/rnn-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blogposts/rnn-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blogposts/rnn-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blogposts/rnn.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> <b>Figure 2:</b> Recurrent Neural Network: each time step $t$ processes an input $x_t$ and outputs an output $o_t$.

(2014) <d-cite key="chung-etal-2014-empirical"></d-cite>. The key idea behind GRU is the use of gate mechanisms that open or close the information flow (i.e., control when and how much to update the context vector in a given time step). This allows the context to flow for longer sequences, as some unimportant states can be ignored.</p> <div class="row mt-3" style="max-width: 50%; height: auto; margin: 0 auto;"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blogposts/gru-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blogposts/gru-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blogposts/gru-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blogposts/gru.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> <b>Figure 3:</b> The update gate $z$ selects whether the hidden state $h_t$ is to be updated with a new hidden state $\tilde{h}_t$.

Source: Cho, Kyunghyun, et al. <d-cite key="cho-etal-2014-learning"></d-cite> </div> <p>There are two major shortcomings in these RNN approaches:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Information is lost over long-contexts</strong>: for long sequences, the state vector loses the context from previous time steps. A single vector does not provide enough bandwidth to carry all relevant information over the long context.</li> <li><strong>Compute inefficiency due to non-paralallelisable operations</strong>: To generate a token $o_t$ at time step $t$, we need to process all previous inputs $x_i$ at time step $i &lt; t$ sequentially, which is computationally inefficient.</li> </ul> <p>The transformer architecture addresses these shortcomings by:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Using Self-Attention:</strong> Instead of having a state vector be updated at each time step, the transformer uses the self-attention (SA) mechanism to allow all tokens to capture each other’s context. Also, this token attention is not computed sequentially. A token $x_t$ attends to all tokens $x_i$ with $i &lt; t$ simultaneously. On itself, this is would be a limitation, since we lose notion of word ordering. On LSTMs, because the vector is updated sequentially, we preserve the order of information flow (from first word to last). With SA, we lose the notion of word ordering, because there is no sequencing in the computation. To fix this, we introduce positional embeddings, which will be discussed later. <ul> <li>SA allows a token $x_t$ to attend to previous tokens with the same strength as any other token, close or far from itself. Thus, it fixes the information loss over long-contexts.</li> <li>SA is not sequential, thus we can compute the attention scores for all pairs of tokens in the sequence in a very efficient and parallelisable way with matrix multiplication.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>However there is one important shortcoming introduced in the transformer architecture with respect to previous RNN approaches:</p> <ul> <li>Now that we don’t have recursion, we must define a fixed context length (i.e., the maximum number of elements in the sequence).</li> <li>If an input sequence is smaller than this length, we fill the sequence with special tokens such as &lt;PAD&gt; tokens.</li> <li>If an input sequence is larger than this length, we have to discard some tokens. Usually we truncate the sequence up to <i>max_seq_len</i> tokens, and discard the remaining tokens.</li> <li>All transformer-based approaches have this pre-defined maximum sequence length. For most models similar to BERT, the maximum length is $512$ tokens. For GPT-2 it is $1024$, GPT-3 is $2048$, LLaMa3 is around $8000$ tokens.</li> </ul> <h1 id="components">Components</h1> <h2 id="multi-head-self-attention-mha">Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHA)</h2> <p>The Multi-Head Self-Attention mechanism allows words in the sequence to “pay attention” (attend) to each other, and through the learning procedure, eventually they will be able of identifying which words from previous time-steps are relevant to generate the element for the current time step.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blogposts/attention-example-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blogposts/attention-example-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blogposts/attention-example-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blogposts/attention-example.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> <b>Figure 4:</b> Self-Attention: The red word is the word being generated at the current time step.

Multi-head attention mitigates this by distributing the learning task across multiple heads, reducing the risk of bottlenecks where certain crucial information might be missed or underrepresented. In other words, each head will learn a different latent space, and encode its specialized features into a segment of the final vector. Hopefully each of these segments will capture specialized characteristics of the data, as opposed to having a single vector space encoding everything as in the single SA unit.</p> <h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3> <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">HeadAttention</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">nn</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Module</span><span class="p">):</span>

Mikolov et al. (2013) <d-cite key="mikolov-2013-efficient"></d-cite> introduced the concept of word embeddings, which are latent vectors that capture the semantics of words.</p> <p>In transformers, we also define an embedding matrix that will be learned jointly with the other components. The embedding matrix is initialised randomly, and is of dimension (<i>vocabulary_size</i>, <i>embedding_dimension</i>). Each input token will retrieve an embedding from the table. This embedding will then represent this token in input space.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blogposts/word-embeddings-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blogposts/word-embeddings-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blogposts/word-embeddings-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blogposts/word-embeddings.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> <b>Figure 8:</b> Word Embeddings (<a href="https://arize.com/blog-course/embeddings-meaning-examples-and-how-to-compute/">Source</a>). </div> <p>Along the word embeddings, the transformer architecture defines a second type of embedding called <strong>positional encodings</strong>. Previously in this document we discussed how the SA mechanism doesn’t introduce any notion of space. The model doesn’t know what is the first and the second token and so on. Therefore, we must somehow encode this information.</p> <p>There are many approaches to encode position into the word embeddings. Some approaches don’t involve learning new weights.

</code></pre></div></div> <h2 id="batch-normalisation">Batch Normalisation</h2> <p>Batch normalisation is a procedure that helps stabilise and accelerate the training process by reducing internal covariate shift, which refers to the change in the distribution of layer inputs during training. It consists in normalising the outputs of the layers so that their distribution have a mean of $0$ and a variance of $1$, then applying two learned parameters to scale and shift the distribution. This reduces the chance that gradients explode or vanish (grow or shrink exponentially). This is a key engineering component in ensuring that large and deep neural networks can converge in a stable fashion.</p> <p>To normalise an input batch, we scale it in this fashion:</p> \[\hat{x}_i = \frac{x_i - \mu_B}{\sqrt{\sigma_B^2 + \epsilon}}\] <p>where $\mu_B$ is the mean of the mini-batch, $\sigma_B^2$ is the variance of the mini-batch, and $\epsilon$ is a small constant added for numerical stability.</p> <p>Next, we define two learnable parameters gamma and beta to allow the model to reconstruct the original (non-scaled) distribution, if needed:</p> \[out = \gamma \hat{x}_i + \beta\] <p>If the learned $\gamma$ is equal to $1$ and the learned $\beta$ is equal to $0$, this layer is simply normalising the input to mean $0$ and variance $1$. However, the model may learn other parameters that allows it to scale and shift the distribution as it pleases.</p> <h3 id="implementation-3">Implementation</h3> <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">BatchNorm</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">nn</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Module</span><span class="p">):</span>

It is a technique to address the problem of vanishing gradients and to make it easier to train very deep neural networks.</p> <p>As neural networks become deeper, gradients can become very small during backpropagation, making it difficult to update the weights of earlier layers effectively. This can lead to very slow convergence or even stopping learning altogether.</p> <p>Residual connections address these issues by allowing the gradient to flow directly through the network, making it easier to train deep networks. They work by adding the input of a layer to its output, effectively allowing the network to learn a residual mapping (identity function).</p> <div class="row mt-3" style="max-width: 80%; height: auto; margin: 0 auto;"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blogposts/residual-connection-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blogposts/residual-connection-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blogposts/residual-connection-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blogposts/residual-connection.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> <b>Figure 11:</b> Residual Connection in a feed forward neural network. The input $X$ branches in two directions: the first direction goes into the MLP and is processed normally. The other direction skips the MLP completely, (i.e., the input is not changed at all). Both branches are aggregated afterwards. Source: He, Kaiming, et al. (2016) <d-cite key="he-2016-deep"></d-cite>. </div> <p>For very deep neural nets, at some point the data transformations being applied to the input are not beneficial anymore, and performance starts decreasing. To fix this, residual connections allow some layers to simply learn “nothing”, i.e. learn to pass the input as the output without modifying it whatsoever (i.e., learn the identity function). With this approach, scaling the network should never hurt performance, as it can simply stop learning new functions if needed.</p> <h3 id="implementation-4">Implementation</h3> <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">GenericLayer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">nn</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Module</span><span class="p">):</span>

In other words, we don’t apply the masking step described previously, allowing tokens from time step t attend to <strong>ALL</strong> tokens (from past and future time steps) instead of only the past tokens.</li> <li>In general terms, the model is allowed to process the entire sequence first, and then it will generate the output tokens, as opposed to looking at previous tokens and predicting the current token.</li> <li>However, these advantages come with the downside of higher computational cost and complexity. Moreover, research found that other variations are more suitable for tasks where this bidirectionality is not needed.</li> <li>Examples of Encoder-Decoder models: BART, T5, T0</li> <li>One important implementation detail about encoder-decoder architectures that was not mentioned previously, is that the second MHA layer in the decoder takes the Key and the Value outputs from the encoder as input, while the Query comes from the Masked MHA from the encoder (refer to the first figure).</li> </ul> <h2 id="encoder-only-suitable-for-input-understanding-tasks-eg-classification">Encoder-only (suitable for input understanding tasks e.g. classification)</h2> <ul> <li>Encoder-only architectures are suitable for classification tasks, since we don’t want to map the input sequence to another sequence, but rather map the input sequence to a pre-defined set of labels. Therefore, we only need to encode, i.e., learn how to represent the sequence in latent space, and then append a classification head on top to discriminate between the classes. Common tasks using encoder-only models include: text classification, named entity recognition (NER), question answering (with extractive approaches), document embeddings.</li> <li>Encoder-only models also have bidirectionality, and are simpler and more efficient than encoder-decoder models. However, they are not suitable for generative tasks, as they only encode the sequence, but can’t decode it.</li> <li>Examples of encoder-only models: BERT, RoBERTa, DeBERTa</li> </ul> <h2 id="decoder-only-suitable-for-generative-tasks">Decoder-only (suitable for generative tasks)</h2> <ul> <li>Decoder-only architectures are suitable for generative tasks, since these settings are naturally autoregressive (dependant on previous context, not on future context).</li> <li>Generative tasks using decoder-only models include: language modelling, text generation, dialogue systems, text autocompletion.</li> <li>Examples of decoder-only models: XLNeT, GPT-3, ChatGPT, LLaMa.</li> </ul>]]></content><author><name>João Leite</name></author><category term="study"/><category term="nlp"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Notes on the Transformer architecture.]]></summary></entry></feed>
